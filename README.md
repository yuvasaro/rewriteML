# rewriteML

This is my Machine Learning coding journal! I am currently self-studying machine learning and find it to be very fun and intriguing. 
Through this project I am documenting my journey of learning ML by re-coding machine learning concepts that I have learned. My aim is to 
thoroughly learn and understand machine learning concepts and to be able to recreate ML techniques using my knowledge of linear algebra, 
calculus, statistics, and Python programming.
